# Librum

Librum is an application designed to make reading <b>enjoyable</b> and <b>straightforward</b> for you.

It's more than just an e-book reader. With Librum, you can manage your own online library and access it from all your devices at any time. It offers features like note-taking, bookmarking, highlighting, while being able to customise the application to look and feel exactly how you want it to. 
Librum also provides free access to over 70,000 books and your reading statistics while being free and completely open source.

<br>
<b>Note</b>: Librum is still in development, the servers are <b>not</b> public, and thus Librum is not yet available for public use.
An alpha release will be available soon, bringing the servers online and making the application available to end users.

# Getting started

Instructions to get Librum up and running in your environment.

<b>Note</b>: Librum currently relies on KDE's infrastructure for okular. This will change soon, however for the time being, Librum and Okular may conflict.
If there is an issue with the Librum installation, consider temporarily uninstalling okular. 
<br>
<br>

## For GNU/Linux
### Foreword
Since Librum is a Qt and KDE application, the Qt and KDE libraries are necessary to run Librum. If you are on a Linux distribution that uses KDE Plasma, you are good to go; else you will need to download the dependencies.

<br>

### Prerequisites for Everyone
- cmake (at least version 3.21)     https://cmake.org/download/
- make (or any other build system)  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/
- Gcc (or any other c++ compiler)   https://gcc.gnu.org/

<br>

### Prerequisites for KDE Plasma Users
- Extra-cmake-modules               https://github.com/KDE/extra-cmake-modules  (Many package managers list them as `extra-cmake-modules`)

<br>

### Prerequisites for Ubuntu Users
Run the following commands to install all dependencies for Librum

```sh
sudo apt update
```
    
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential extra-cmake-modules qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qtquickcontrols2-5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls2 libkf5parts-dev libkf5crash-dev libkf5textwidgets-dev libkf5archive-dev libkf5threadweaver-dev libkf5activities-dev libqt5svg5-dev libphonon4qt5-dev libqt5texttospeech5-dev zlib1g-dev libkf5pty-dev qtdeclarative5-private-dev qtbase5-private-dev qml-module-qtquick-shapes qml-module-qt-labs-qmlmodels qml-module-qt-labs-settings qml-module-qt-labs-platform libpoppler-qt5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtquick-window2
```
    
<br>

### Prerequisites for other distros
If you are running on another, non-kde-plasma distro which isn't Ubuntu, you will need to install the dependencies via your distro specific package manager. The packages required should be pretty similar to the ones listed in the "Prerequisites for Ubuntu Users" section, but they might be called differently in your package manager. <br><br>
If you manage to build Librum on a distro that is not listed here, feel free to open a pull request with the instructions to build it on your distro.

<br>
